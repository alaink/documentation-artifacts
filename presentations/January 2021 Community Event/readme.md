Expanding digital technologies have introduced changes in technology and market structure with a renewed focus on cross-border payments. In addition to this, private digital currencies are also being introduced which offer users new choices but present important challenges to central banks and governments. These changes have brought the G20 countries to jointly establish a work plan to address the many moving parts of the payments space.   This session outlines the roadmap commissioned by the G20 that is proposed from the BIS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  I will present the 3 Stages of the program, the 7 Challenges to be addressed, the 5 Focus areas of the work, and the 19 Building Blocks that will drive the overall roadmap for the G20 and beyond. <br /><br />[Session Discussion Thread](https://community.mojaloop.io/t/new-regulatory-building-blocks-for-payments/217) | Business | Presentation | David Mangini                                                           |

Who decides those scheme rules?   What options do consortiums need to consider, regarding the structure and approach to governance of a payments scheme  What are the benefits and downsides of each? What are the consequences for the Mojaloop product roadmap, community, roll-out operating model & sales toolkit for the various models? <br /><br />[Session Discussion Thread](https://community.mojaloop.io/t/real-time-retail-payment-scheme-governance/218)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Business | Presentation | Cici Northup, Elizabeth McQuerry, Laura Dreese, Steve Haley, Paul Makin |

Central banks around the world, especially in developing economies are considering CBDDC to reach every segment of the society, especially those who are underserved by the private banking sector. With a CBDC, the Central Bank can be sure that sovereign currency over existing mobile networks is within reach of everyone as a tool to increase financial inclusion. This presentation will provide the context for CBDC and how Mojaloop is a powerful enabler to interconnect a new CBDC issued by the Central Bank to the mobile operators and other payment systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Community | Presentation            | David Mangini                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1:30 PM          | 1:50 PM        | 20 minutes | OpenG2P: An Open Source Framework for Digitizing Bulk Payments and Transfers          | Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for governments to rapidly disburse payments and cash transfers is ever more critical. OpenG2P aims to provide both a framework and a reference architecture of open source building blocks to address the pervasive challenges of digitizing G2P payments around enrollment, disbursement, and recourse. Recently recognized by the Digital Public Goods Alliance as one of the seven foundation digital public goods for the Financial Inclusion Community of Practice, OpenG2P will transform the currently cumbersome and costly process for mobilizing cash transfers through a set of re-usable open source components that can be plugged in alongside the current systems in place. This session will provide a conceptual overview of the framework and how it leverages other digital public goods like Mosip for identity, Mojaloop for payments, and Mifos for accounts, as well as a high-level demonstration of the current stack. | Business  | Presentation            | Keyzom Massally, Edward Cable                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

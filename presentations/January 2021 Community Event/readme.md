| 1:30 PM          | 2:10 PM        | 40 minutes | New Regulatory Building Blocks for Payments                                    | Banking and Financial Services is undergoing a period of rapid change in many countries. Expanding digital technologies have introduced changes in technology and market structure with a renewed focus on cross-border payments. In addition to this, private digital currencies are also being introduced which offer users new choices but present important challenges to central banks and governments. These changes have brought the G20 countries to jointly establish a work plan to address the many moving parts of the payments space. This session outlines the roadmap commissioned by the G20 that is proposed from the BIS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). I will present the 3 Stages of the program, the 7 Challenges to be addressed, the 5 Focus areas of the work, and the 19 Building Blocks that will drive the overall roadmap for the G20 and beyond. | Business | David Mangini   |                                            |

Central banks around the world, especially in developing economies are considering CBDDC to reach every segment of the society, especially those who are underserved by the private banking sector. With a CBDC, the Central Bank can be sure that sovereign currency over existing mobile networks is within reach of everyone as a tool to increase financial inclusion. This presentation will provide the context for CBDC and how Mojaloop is a powerful enabler to interconnect a new CBDC issued by the Central Bank to the mobile operators and other payment systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Community | David Mangini                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 2:20 PM          | 2:40 PM        | 20 minutes | OpenG2P: An Open Source Framework for Digitizing Bulk Payments and Transfers          | Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for governments to rapidly disburse payments and cash transfers is ever more critical. OpenG2P aims to provide both a framework and a reference architecture of open source building blocks to address the pervasive challenges of digitizing G2P payments around enrollment, disbursement, and recourse. Recently recognized by the Digital Public Goods Alliance as one of the seven foundation digital public goods for the Financial Inclusion Community of Practice, OpenG2P will transform the currently cumbersome and costly process for mobilizing cash transfers through a set of re-usable open source components that can be plugged in alongside the current systems in place. This session will provide a conceptual overview of the framework and how it leverages other digital public goods like Mosip for identity, Mojaloop for payments, and Mifos for accounts, as well as a high-level demonstration of the current stack. | Business  | Keyzom Massally                                                         | Edward Cable                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2:40 PM          | 3:20 PM        | 40 minutes | Building an Entire Digital Financial Services Ecosystem on Open Source                | This session will provide an in-depth look at the Mifos Labs which showcase how you can build an end to end digital financial services ecosystem completely on open source from the ground up. At the foundation is an infrastructural layer with open source APIs for account management from Mifos and Fineract and interoperable payments via Mojaloop orchestrated through an open source gateway, Payment Hub EE. Innovation can flourish at the application layer through open source reference mobile wallet and banking apps accessible via Open Banking APIs, PISP APIs and OTT APIs like the GSMA mobile money API. We will showcase the entire stack, demonstrate its current capabilities, and speak to how the current Mifos and Mojaloop ecosystems are benefitting from it.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Business  | Edward Cable                                                            | Istvan Molnar                                                                                                                                                                       |

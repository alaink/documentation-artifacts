I can work with Lesley-Ann to fill that panel and clearly define it. Recommend a panel of Glenbrook and 2 others (I think it is a helpful strategy for ModusBox and Glenbrook to sit on panels with similar orgs to show the widening of the bench)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                          |                  | for now - see if we can turn around the session with Glenbrook to be more interactive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

How might we harness this to unlock some of the innovation work around the hub that is top of mind, and bring more into the community?<br><br>NB: Inno used to work for FSD Tanzanai where we ran a design sprint with bankers and regulators together.
